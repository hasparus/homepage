Disclaimer: This is a braindump / personal blogging.

The guy sitting next to me at the office has a wallpaper
saying "ALWAYS FUCKING DELIVER." This dude thinks I'm a good developer.
He sometimes asks me for some tips or opinions on code-related stuff.
Little does he know, I am a developer-disappointment.
When it comes to delivering, I ain't close to Jesus.
I'm actually closer to the [Polish Post].

I've failed numerous side projects, which I didn't ship.
A startup idea I was working on with my close friend didn't get sherlocked,
which is hardly a good thing,
because we hadn't even started to ship when it was already too late.

  I've managed to build a bike or maybe even a motorbike once.
  The rest is a garage full of rolling chassis.

I wanted to build a perfect product, with fantastic user experience, the newest
tech&nbsp;stack, the cleanest code, while maintaining some degree of personal life,
passing exams, and completing a thesis. The thesis included an app, which
isn't&nbsp;production-ready (of course), but took more than five hundred hours of work
of&nbsp;my partner and me combined.

**Obviously, I was an idiot.** I bit off more than I could chew.
I started drinking way too much coffee. My, once thick and bushy hair started falling off,
and I'm probably skinnier than I ever was. I don't remember how to prove a thing about
Van&nbsp;Emde&nbsp;Boas trees or Fibonacci heaps. I can probably do a simple amortized
analysis, nothing fancy, though.

On the flip side, I learned. I don't mean computer science. I got really good at
starting&nbsp;projects. I learned GraphQL, got a good grasp of the JavaScript ecosystem
with bundlers, React metaframeworks, and the like, but this isn't the most valuable
piece&nbsp;of knowledge I acquired.

I learned that **communication is key**. Unfortunately, in a hard way.

I've learned that a good chunk of Medium software gurus and best practices
prophets spend more time marketing themselves than actually building software.
Any blogpost claiming that you should few [simple] rules to be a good developer is a hoax.
Instead (unfortunately?), we have to strive to understand the problem at hand, analyze
the&nbsp;choices we have, and put in honest work.

I'm still failing. I've started adding a hamburger menu for this blog.
I've written an SVG by hand, animated it and made it work without JavaScript.
But can you see it? Yeah, I didn't manage to finish the job and actually add it.
This is a failure, but a small one.
I don't need it until I add a "speaking" page with a list of my past meetup
talks and notes or commentary for them.

I've started a [side project] with two friends with whom I played roleplaying games.
Turns out they're kickass developers and we can learn a lot from each other.
I already learned what Event Storming is. We did two sessions of it and goddamn!
If only I knew it before! I'm feeling pretty confident that we'll ship the thing.
We've set the deadline for a prototype we can start dogfooding for the end of
January.
