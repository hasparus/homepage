### Pitch

![matryoshkas](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/5186qD8N%2BpL._SX466_.jpg)

I'm gonna rant about matryoshka code, DRY as dunes of Arrakis and utmost
unpleasant to work with. Have you heard about it?
Are you _guilty_ of writing it?
I'm going to describe the problem and propose few ideas of how to deal with it.
