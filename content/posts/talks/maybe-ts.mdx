I spoke about problems with hard Option type (like the one from fp-ts)
mentioned in Rich Hickey's "Maybe Not" and presented a foldable traversable
monad instance which can used instead of Option to avoid the
problems mentioned by Rich. On top of it, it just works(tm) with optional
chaining and nullish coalescing operators.
