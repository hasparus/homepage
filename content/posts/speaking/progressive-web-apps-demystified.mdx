I had read like a 100 pages of different documentations, and I needed to
share things I learned in the process. I'm not sure if "100 pages" is a
hyperbole here.

## The Talk

**Dan Questions**:

- How will you deliver the idea to the audience?

  - I'll zoom in from the problem description to a case study and add a few
    jokes in-between.

- What is the one thing that you want people to take away from your talk?

  - It's not hard to make an app _progressive_, but it is hard to know what
    your client means by _progressive_ without talking about it.

- Why are you giving the talk? What is the emotional core? What do you
  believe in?

  - We deserve websites prepared for flaky internet connections of today.
