### Outline

A 15 minutes presentation, where I claim that React is a better tool to build
static websites than Pug, because components are superior to mixins and partials.
I introduced CSS-in-JS to improve the productivity and basics of TypeScript
to make teamwork silky smooth.

- TypeScript
  - You have types in JavaScript, you just can't write about them
  - Bugs aren't fun. Especially if we didn't estimate them
  - The stricter, the better
  - Introduction to syntax
- React
  - Building with components is simpler than smart design patters with
    fancy acronyms (MCV, MVI, MVC, MVVM, MVP)
  - Components introduce a _contract_ `props -> element`
    ```ts
    type FunctionComponent<P> = (
      props: P & { children?: ReactNode }
    ) => ReactElement | null;
    ```
- CSS-in-JS
  - [Colocation](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/colocation)
- Live Coding of a website
  - SSG vs SSR
  - renderToStaticMarkup
  - renderToString
  - what is hydration?
  - reinventing the wheel for educational purposes
    - don't do it at home, use Gatsby or react-snap
