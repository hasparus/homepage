### Pitch

TypeScript 3.7 brings us an amazing tool to concisely write preconditions
that can't be described in a function signature.
With assertion signatures we can get rid of these ugly
`if (not cool) throw new Error("totally not cool")` blocks.

We're gonna talk about partial and total functions,
returning vs throwing errors and I'll show you how assertion signatures
make my React code safer.
