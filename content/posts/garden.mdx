This is a README of this website, describing the interesting bits of
the tech stack, the motivation behind it, and the goals of it.

## The Story

I encountered swyx's [Learn in Public] and realized I'm an idiot.
I was doing a heckload of notes. It was before I found out about Roam,
so my notes were a chaotic mess of random Notion pages,
Dropbox Paper docs and sheets I took out of the printer to cover with
illegible hieroglyphs.

"Maybe I can make them helpful for somebody else," I thought.
Spellcheck them in Grammarly. Write a bunch of MDX files.
Publish them with Gatsby.

I started a blog. Turns out, blogging is hard for me.
Polishing one piece of notes to "blog post quality" took a few days of
writing and two weeks of minor fixes. I tried hard because I heard
a lot about building a personal brand. Somebody asked how many
impressions I make and where do they come from.
What? I didn't set up analytics. I don't want to!

I want to publish the good parts of my notes and link to cool stuff I
found on the internet. I want to have a personal website,
like my [lecturers] at the uni. A bit ugly.
Practical and fun in a little weird way.

Take a look at swyx.io.
It has a big heading saying "SWYX'S SITE!".
The about page is empty.
These gradient link hovers aren't pretty,
but they put a big smile on my face.
It's awesome.

I'm gonna go this way.
I want to stop spending half of my free evenings on this website
and have fun with it.

Turns out I'm not the only one.

Here are the articles that clarified the idea for me and inspired me
in the order I read them.

## Cool Bits

- Displaying git log of a blog post for transparency.

### Blog post git log

# TODO

- [ ] TLDR What I do (display git log of a blog post) and why (transparency, showing the journey)
- [ ] Write a tutorial on how I did it

The dates of posts are pretty problematic. I update my posts sometimes.
Should I change the date then?

Kent C. Dodds asked "why doesn't he have dates on his blog posts" said
he just keeps all of them up to date. Publish dates would be confusing.
I get that point, but I kinda wanna keep the dates, at least for myself
as a *created_at* information.

Instead of showing less dates, I decided to show more. I keep my posts
in a git repository, so I have a farily good idea what and when was changed.

- I formatted the git log in a parseable way
- Parsed it in gatsby-node.js and added it into Gatsby's GraphQL schema
- Added history and historySource to frontmatter
- Rendered it in post template
