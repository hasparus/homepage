<!-- TODO: Finish me -->

This is a README of this website, describing the interesting bits of
the tech stack, the motivation behind it and the goals of it.

I encountered swyx's Learn in Public and realized I'm an idiot.
I was doing a heckload of notes. It was before I found out about Roam,
so my notes were a chaotic mess of random Notion pages,
Dropbox Paper docs and sheets I took out of the printer to cover with
illegible hieroglyphs.
