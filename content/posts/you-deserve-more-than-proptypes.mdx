<Epistemic effort>
  I've spent a good amount of time discussing it. I'm willing to engage in a
  conversation if you'd like to teach me something new on the matter or prove me
  wrong.
</Epistemic>

I'm starting with reasons why I think PropTypes are not good enough, and later
I'm showing what TypeScript gives you to solve these problems and
improve your React code even more on top of it.

I'd like to be clear -- I'm not bashing [prop-types](https://www.npmjs.com/package/prop-types) --
It's a really good library, but the last publish was 9 months ago.
As I'm writing this, it's November 2019, and there are much better
alternatives for prop types.

I've chosen TypeScript because of its popularity,
but my arguments fit any language with first-class type composition you
can use to build React apps (Flow, Reason, Kotlin, Scala).

## Why?

### It's easy to half-ass PropTypes

I've seen hundreds of lines with `//eslint-disable-next-line react/forbid-prop-types`.
I have seen few codebases where PropTypes are leveraged to their full potential.
([Reach UI](https://github.com/reach/reach-ui/blob/master/packages/tabs/src/index.js#L68)
is one of them.)

I find exporting propTypes uncommon.
Instead of using exported common types, developers either use PropTypes.object
or copy PropTypes.shape from another component.

Maybe it is hard to remember that you strip them out in production build,
and that's why the devs I've met don't want to make them too big and heavy?

### PropTypes.func is just not enough

Functions make stuff happen. They are pretty important.
Types of functions are important too.
Stating that a prop is just a function, doesn't document intent.
You still need to read the implementation to get the slightest idea of what's happening.

<figure>

```kt
interface VideoListProps : RProps {
    var videos: List<Video>
    var selectedVideo: Video?
    var onSelectVideo: (Video) -> Unit
}
```

</figcaption>

</figure>

Take a look at the props above. `onSelectVideo` takes a video and returns a unit.
This is a lot more information than "`onSelectVideo` is a function".
We could argue that the name of the function should be enough,
but what if a possibility to select multiple videos was added later,
as an additional feature?
If someone forgot to change the function name, `PropTypes.func` would still fit,
and some other poor soul would get surprised by a runtime error.

### Optional is a bad default for application code

I do agree that nullable by default is a good design choice in some cases.
GraphQL is a [perfect example].
Responses stitched from many data stores may return partial data.
This is the complexity we have to handle.

And I'd say we have about enough of it. We should avoid introducing more complexity
ourselves. Every optional field without a default of the same type increases
cyclomatic complexity.

Typing `isRequired` is yet another small decision for a programmer. The fact that stating
that a prop is nullable is an easier way allows to accidentally introduce complexity.

[perfect example]: https://github.com/graphql/graphql-spec/issues/63

<figure>

```js
Person.propTypes = {
  car: PropTypes.shape({
    registrationNumber: PropTypes.string,
    year: PropTypes.number,
  }),
};
```

<figcaption>

in google search results for "PropTypes isRequired"

</figcaption>

</figure>

Does this person have a car? Maybe. I live in a big city; I don't have one too.
But is an empty object `{}` really a valid car for our app?
Do we display an error message here? Did we just forget to write `isRequired`, or are we
okay with cars without license plates?

`isOptional` instead of `isRequired` would be a better API design.

## type Props = ?

TypeScript is much better in describing React component props than PropTypes. \
Let's look at how it solves the problems I've mentioned before.

- _easy to half-ass?_ -- Add `strict: true` to your tsconfig.json,
  stray from `any` and now you're forced to maintain a decent level of type safety.
  Also, it's pretty obvious, even before a morning coffee, that it has no runtime cost.
- _typing functions?_ -- `(selected: Video) => void`. Pretty easy, amiright?
- _optional by default?_ -- You gotta stick this `?` every time you want an optional property.

  <figure>

  ```ts
  type Car = {
    registrationNumber: string;
    year?: number;
  };
  ```

  <figcaption>We deal only with registered cars up in here.</figcaption>

And look at what else we get!

### ComponentProps<`"`button`"`>

I could talk about subtyping and Liskov Substitution Principle,
but I'll simplify it a little bit. \
**If it's a button, it should be buttony.**
Props you expect on a button should be accepted by all of your design
system buttons. What do I expect?
At least `onClick`, `onFocus`, `disabled`, `className`, and `style`.
We can handle all attributes of HTML [`<button>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/button)
element, including all [global attributes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes)
with a simple [spread](https://reactpatterns.com/#jsx-spread-attributes)

<figure>

```tsx
import { ComponentProps, FC } from "react";

type ButtonVariant = "default" | "call-to-action";

interface ButtonProps extends ComponentProps<"button"> {
  variant?: ButtonVariant;
}
```

<figcaption>

</figcaption>

</figure>

Do you want **your Button** to be inferior to **a button**? I don't think so.

### Omit<LinkProps, `"`to`"`>

But what if my component comes "batteries included" and I don't want to accept all props
of the component I'm building upon? Only like... most of them? We can Omit what we don't
like. Just like that.

```tsx
interface JoinMeetingButton
  extends Omit<ButtonProps, "onClick">,
    Pick<Meeting, "id"> {}
```

### Union Types

My anchors and buttons look the same in the mockups.

Any difference between HTMLAnchorElement and HTMLButtonElement is an implementation detail.
My designer colleague shouldn't worry about it when he sees some [JSX in Zeplin]
or prototypes in [Playroom]. Neither should my developer colleague when he wants to reuse
some UI logic.

I can use [union types] to build a Button component which renders an anchor, given a `href`
prop and renders a `<button>` otherwise.

[union types]: https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/advanced-types.html#union-types

```tsx
import { ComponentProps } from "react";

interface ButtonAsAnchorProps extends ComponentProps<"a"> {
  href: string;
}
interface ButtonAsButtonProps extends ComponentProps<"button"> {
  href?: undefined;
}

type ButtonProps = ButtonAsAnchorProps | ButtonAsButtonProps;

function Button({ className: propsClassName, ...rest }: ButtonProps) {
  const className = ["Button", propsClassName].join(" ");

  if (rest.href !== undefined) {
    return <a className={className} {...rest} />;
  }

  return <button className={className} {...rest} />;
}
```

### Pick<Meeting, `"`date`"` | `"`organizer`"`>

We can select properties from our types with `Pick`.

```tsx
type MeetingInfoProps = Pick<Meeting, "date" | "organizer">;
const MeetingInfo = ({ date, organizer }: MeetingInfoProps) => (
  <>
    {new Date(date).toLocaleString()} • {organizer.name}
  </>
);
```

Imagine that _Meeting_ is a type of data we get from the backend.
We want to show MeetingInfo -- a date and organizer of the meeting and
we don't really care about the type of these `date` and `organizer` props.
We care about their origin. They come from the _Meeting_ type and that's what's
important for this component. Will this component break when the representation
of our meetings? Yes. And we want it to. Also, [we avoid introducing new names]
(e.g.`<MeetingInfo author={meeting.organizer} />`).

## Summary

PropTypes are not _first class_. They're a library trying to implement what
is often a language feature. If you're building an app, you don't need runtime typechecking.
If you're using `prop-types`, try swapping them for TypeScript or Flow and
[tweet me](https://twitter.com/hasparus) what you think.
