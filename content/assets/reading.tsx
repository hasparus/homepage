          > TODO doesn’t mean you actually intend to do something.
            It’s a marker for the next person that the logic was
            left unfinished...

          TODO comments are good.

          I believe that honesty is the essential quality of a software engineer.
          Whenever I have a vague idea of how to fix/improve something but no
          time to do it, I'll leave a todo. Whenever I do a hack, I'll admit it
          in the comment, explain why it's bad and what problems we should expect.

          It wasn't obvious to me when I learned to program.
          "My code doesn't need comments." -- I thought.
          Clean code is final. It is supposed to be beautiful, almost perfect, right?
          It grew on me with time, while working with deadlines, clients,
          project managers, and legacy code.
          
          Code Review comments perish. They have to be searched for.
          They can be lost while migrating between version control systems
          or VCS hosting services. Conversations on Slack or JIRA tickets are
          even more ephemeral. TODO comments are immortal. The memory of them
          will survive in your git history.

      I love the paragraph about [stock and flow](https://tomcritchlow.com/2019/02/17/building-digital-garden#stock-over-flow).
      The stock — high-quality, long-lasting content — is something I aspire to 
      accumulate here.
      Tim got me hooked on nurturing my own digital garden.
      This page is one way to do it — a reference
      point for conversations with friends. After I write some more articles,
      I'm going to add a table of contents and highlight my favorite work.
