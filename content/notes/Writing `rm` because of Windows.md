## Problem

I happen to have a Windows laptop in my possession, and I'm stubborn enough
to use it for coding. Fortunately, I am also stubborn enough to get it to
work.

### `rm -rf` doesn't work on Windows.

1.  Powershell on it has [`Remove-Item`] aliased to `rm`.

    This would almost solve the problem, but...

    ```
    Remove-Item : A parameter cannot be found that matches parameter name 'rf'.
    At line:1 char:4
    + rm -rf dist
    ```

    Powershell, _unlike [`getopt`]_, doesn't allow specifying multiple
    options together.

2.  `rm -r -f` doesn't work too, because -f is ambiguous.

    ```
    Remove-Item : Parameter cannot be processed because the parameter name 'f' is ambiguous.
    Possible matches include: -Filter -Force.
    At line:1 char:7
    + rm -r -f dist
    ```

    All right, for a few months I've been writing `rm -r -fo` whenever I had
    to remove `node_modules`.

    I aliased<Footnote.A number={1}> it to `rmrf` for convenience and with
    the following

    ```powershell
    function rmrf {
      param(
            [parameter(Position=0)][string]$directory
      )
      process {
         # rm -r -fo $directory
         Remove-Item -Recurse -Force $directory
      }
    }
    ```

<Footnote number={1}>
  Powershell aliases can't be used to partially apply arguments.
  Docs for [`Set-Alias`] basically tell you to write a function instead.

### Alias was not enough

When I started my career in Polish companies, we often had somebody on
MacOS, somebody on Linux and somebody on Windows in the team. Mac was
slightly more popular as a standard _company issued notebook for
developers_, but I remember we often had a mix.

When I work on open source, the projects are usually system agnostic (it's
not super hard in web ecosystem), using `rimraf` instead of `rm -rf`, using
`dotenv`, writing scripts in JavaScript or Python etc.

Surprisingly, 41.2% StackOverflow Survey respondents use Windows and only
30% use MacOS.

My anecdata looks more like 75% MacOS, 15% Linux, 10% Windows, but from a
perspective of open source guy, I wouldn't want to break the build for 10%
of users or lose 10% of contributors.

However, in a startup setting, the situation is totally different.

The company offered to buy me a Mac, but the orders take about 7 weeks. So,
I had a choice. I could either bother my teammates to make the project
system-agnostic, or deal with it on my side.

A smarter man might have gone to the store, get any MacBook they have, and
be done with it.

### Writing my own `rm` in Rust

Googling "rm for Windows" didn't get me any useful results, so I quickly
wrote my own, very dirty, totally not production-grade, `rm` to stick in my
`bin` directory.

**Disclaimer:** Writing the code took me less time than I've been writing
this note, so I provide no guarantees to the quality and correctness of the
code. I didn't even write any error messages, because exposing the error
from `std::fs` is totally fine for my use case.

<details>
  <summary><code>src/main.rs</code></summary>

```rust
use clap::Parser;

#[derive(Parser, Debug)]
#[clap(author, version, about, long_about = None)]
struct Args {
  #[clap(short, long)]
  recursive: bool,

  #[clap(short, long)]
  force: bool,

  #[clap()]
  files: Vec<String>,
}

fn rm(args: Args) -> std::io::Result<()> {
  for file in args.files {
      if args.recursive {
          if args.force {
              std::fs::remove_dir_all(file)?;
          } else {
              std::fs::remove_dir(file)?;
          }
      } else {
          std::fs::remove_file(file)?;
      }
  }

  return std::io::Result::Ok(());
}

fn main() {
  let args = Args::parse();
  Result::unwrap(rm(args))
}
```

</details>

I removed the alias by adding the following to my `$PROFILE`.

```powershell
Remove-Item -Path Alias:rm
```

I promptly ran `cargo build --release` and I added my newest toy to a
directory I already had in `PATH`.

```
‚ùØ ls

    Directory: D:\tools\bin
