👋 Hello there. I'm&nbsp;Piotr&nbsp;Monwid&#8209Olechnowicz.

<!-- TODO: Too personal? Would fit /about page better. Revise this? -->

I build software while [listening] to lo-fi and city pop. I like
coffee, typed FP, tabletop RPG, and my fiancée, who didn't force
me to write this. At all. I&nbsp;pride myself on my bad sense of
humor.

I currently specialize in React and TypeScript, organize [two]&nbsp;[tech] meetups, and
try to give back to FOSS as much as I can.

This is [my personal space] on the internet, where
I&nbsp;[write blog posts], [collect&nbsp;things] that influenced me,
and comment on them. I&nbsp;learn in public.
