## Open Source

I believe in community-driven collaboration through open source. It's what makes
the web the most expansive and accessible ecosystem in the industry. I've seen
it change people's lives, including my own.

I maintain Theme UI, and I tend to help out with problems I encounter. \
More than 455 of my PRs were merged to public repositories.

My most recent small but cool contribution was adding multiplayer collaboration
to [novel.sh](https://github.com/steven-tey/novel/pull/18).

## Education

### BSc Computer Science, University of Wrocław

I learned to google really hard and read research papers.

I don't write Haskell nor Prolog nor x86-64 assembly nowadays, and I probably
wouldn't be able to repeat all the logic and discrete math proofs that I used to
be able to do, but the uni taught me patience, curiosity and "I don't know this
**yet**, give me a few hours to read" attitude.
