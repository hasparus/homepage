title: "node:crypto is underused"
---

I'm not saying everybody needs to be a security expert. I'm def not one! But I
feel that many engineers I know are needlessly scared of cryptography. With just
a tiny sprinkle of it, we can do amazing things: like keeping our users' data
private with encryption or signing stuff we give out to the public to guarantee
it hasn't been tampered with. It's been a while since I've written a
tutorial-style blog post, so here&nbsp;it goes.

<aside>

`node:` URL scheme was added in Node v12.20.0. The `crypto` package on NPM is
deprecated, so you won't ever import a malicious package here. Regardless, I'll
refer to it with a prefix to discern from capitalized `Crypto` Web API.
