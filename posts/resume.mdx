#### Open Source

I believe in community-driven collaboration through open source. It's what makes
the web the most expansive and accessible ecosystem in the industry. I've seen
it change people's lives, including my own.

I maintain Theme UI, and I tend to help out with problems I encounter. \
More than 455 of my PRs were merged to public repositories.
