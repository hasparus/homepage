I always liked the old web of MySpace, personal blogs, and Tumblr sites. It felt
more human back then, more heartfelt. We kinda lost it along the way when the
web has split into content creators and consumers.

Arc Boosts allow the end user to customize websites to their liking. It hits a
nostalgic note with bleeding edge

features, but even its basic features like CSS editing are a nice tool for
software engineers and designers.

Of course, in all browsers tech-savvy can already modify HTML and CSS in the
DevTools, but your edits don't save between reloads. It's disputable if it's
more convenient than changing the source code with

Boosts democratize tweaking websites. A non-technical marketing manager can now
propose design changes with more accuracy than sending screenshots of
competition's apps on Slack.

It's well known that short feedback foster productivity. Boosts shorten the
feedback loop. Both for software professionals, and end-users, it's a great
feature. I love it, that's all.
