title: Don't leak. Export.

---

If you export a function, the types of its arguments leak.

Even if your language of choice doesn't allow you to write
`ReturnType<typeof f>` and you can't refer to them, their _concept_ leaks and
you need to be somewhat aware of it when using this function.

```diff
- type Props = {
+ export interface ChatProps {
```

```diff
- export function Chat(props: Props) {
+ export function Chat(props: ChatProps) {
```
