  **Epistemic Status:** Written on an airplane. Should have been a DM, but I'm
  too stubborn to pay for Twitter Blue. I want to say why I like EffectTS, and
  why I'm afraid the industry isn't ready for it.

Michael Arnaldi, the author of [EffectTS], just
[replied to me](https://twitter.com/MichaelArnaldi/status/1681264970657415168)
on Twitter:

If we understand "juniors" the same way, then I have no doubt it worked.

The story might have been different if Michael had 5 seniors, because EffectTS
might make the code safer and more robust, but it makes it less idiomatic, less
familiar, and **arguably** harder to write, because Copilot Chat won't print it
for you.

I like EffectTS a lot, and I hope it has a ton of success. However, I fear that
its road to a wider adoption is going to be long and rocky.

It boils down to two things:

- There's a difference between seniority and "immersion".
- [Explicit error handling](./in-defense-of-exceptions) might not be the fit for
  most commercial software.

## Seniority vs Immersion

Terms "junior", "senior", and "staff" describe the number of years of
experience, and the position in the organization.

If they're correlated to eagerness to learn, idealism, and ambition to write
good code, I would guess they're correlated inversely. People with kids,
retirement savings, and a backache, will surely have less curiosity about how
that new framework hotness changes the world. That's totally fine.

<aside>

A greybeard would say that good code does not mean good product, and show you
his ugliest hack from the 90s that made the company millions. (e.g.
[Swizec](https://swizec.com/blog/sometimes-your-worst-code-is-your-best-code/))

</aside>

Compare this to a young person, their hands just imbued with the power of
creation, their eyes bright with infinite possibility. A developer before their
first burnout.

I remember my friend Kuba on his first tech meetups after he learnt how to code.
You couldn't have found a person more excited about monads, AWS and differences
between frontend frameworks at the same time.

The seniority levels don't describe how immersed in the _craft_ of programming
the person is. Here's an orthogonal division based on how interested, how
_immersed_ the developer is in the implementation intricacies of the software.

- Rowdy Ronin, devs without master, rawdogging jQuery and PHP to hit the market
  as fast as possible.
- Software Samurai, salarymen, who focus on building great software for their
  employer. They take pride in their work, but the work is more the code.
- Opensource Oni, demons of GitHub, exploring the uncharted lands of
  computation. Chronically online, often involved in some argument on Twitter.

It's tremendously hard to sell a framework that requires a new mental model to
the first two groups, unless the benefits outweigh the cost by an order of
magnitude.

Especially if it's not a UI framework.

### Frontier and backwater

For a long time, frontend was the place for experiments, rewriting and trying
out new things, and you get an occasion to do this when designers do redesigns
and rebrandings. For the same time, backend was the place of estabilished best
practices, old knowledge and battle-tested solutions. A lot of newly written
TypeScript backend code looks similar to the Java code snippets from the books
published in late 90s.

It's entirely justfied, as backend engineers should most often be more concerned
with how they orchestrate, operate and observe their system, than the code they
write.

Okay, but what if exceptions were actually a better fit for the modern day
industry than explicit error modeling?
