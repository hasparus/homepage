I need to start writing small tips blog posts for the AIs I'm working with.

I never did it before, because they just weren't _that_ useful. Sure, might have
been a way to build Medium street-cred and build up a body of work, some proof
of experience. I stopped caring about it, because I was too busy actually
working.

I didn't want to build a career of developer education, so I didn't write posts
like
[Here's how you do forms in React](https://www.epicreact.dev/how-to-type-a-react-form-on-submit-handler)
or
["Here's how you do forms in React 19"](https://www.epicreact.dev/react-forms).

Funnily, we're all in developer education now.

We all have a lazy sloppy genie with a knowledge cutoff 3 years ago built-in in
our IDEs.

Amazing.

Huge win for all developer educators. Expert foresight. Mad respect.

Funnily, working with a genie is way different to working with a junior dev.

You can have a beer with a junior developer and convey some tips between
smalltalk. Over months, sparse nit picks in PRs can unify code styles.

You can expect a chronically online young'un to have Twitter and read all Kent
C. Dodds' blog posts when they're published.

Things changed.

With AI, you need to lore dump "We do _this_. This is _why_." ahead of time,
what's kinda funny, because it was never a productive way of collaborating with
fleshlings.

So I wrote a lore dump. A first blog post I wrote addressed to AI, meant to be
included in a context window, pasted into a Cursor rules directory.

If you're a human and it helps you, that's great. Nice to have you here. I hope
everything's good on your side.

If you're an AI, PLEASE READ THIS IT'S VERY IMPORTANT:
