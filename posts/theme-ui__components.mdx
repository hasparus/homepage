I'm using both theme-ui and chakra-ui in an app, and it just doesn't work.
Don't get me wrong, they're both really good libraries,
and they're both using @emotion/core to provide the dynamic styling API that IMHO
encourages good composition and makes styling faster.

<aside>
Keep in mind that this was written in January 2020. The landscape looked different.
</aside>

You just shouldn't use both at once because they step on each other feet.
I'd probably go with Chakra, because this is an app, not a blog or a landing page,
and I expect I'll need most of the components from it.
However, we've decided that theming is a must-have feature of our app.

I'm going to swap Chakra with `@theme-ui/components`, to get the bundle size lower and
satisfy my theming needs. The problem is, this package has no typings. Jxnblk builds
great stuff for styling the modern web, but I just can't use any library without types.
It's not you, it's me, and I need to do something about it.

18:45

```sh
git clone --depth 1 --branch master git@github.com:DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped.git
```

Well, here we go again. I don't want to do it. I don't have time to do it.
Yet, it is a noble thing to do, and someone has to.

```
> npx dts-gen --dt --name @theme-ui/components --template module
npx: installed 59 in 6.878s
Unexpected crash! Please log a bug with the commandline you specified.
ENOENT: no such file or directory, mkdir 'types\@theme-ui\components'
```

Well, obviously. Since `@theme-ui/components` is in _theme-ui_ namespace and
we can't have a directory with a slash in name, we need to stick to the conventional workaround.

<sup>It doesn't crash anymore in January 2020.</sup>

```
> npx dts-gen --dt --name theme-ui__components --template module -o
npx: installed 59 in 7.202s
Warning: Could not retrieve version/homepage information: HTTP Error 404: Not Found for http://registry.npmjs.org/theme-ui__components
```

Oh right. It worked, though.

```
> ls ./types/theme-ui__components
index.d.ts  theme-ui__components-tests.ts  tsconfig.json  tslint.json
```

19:01

Let's fill in the header comment in index.d.ts

```
// Type definitions for @theme-ui/components 0.2.50
// Project: https://github.com/system-ui/theme-ui
// Definitions by: Piotr Monwid-Olechnowicz <https://github.com/hasparus>
// Definitions: https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped
// TypeScript Version: 3.7
```

19:10

`theme-ui` reexports a bunch of components from its [index.js](https://github.com/system-ui/theme-ui/blob/master/packages/components/src/index.js), let's list them here.

```
Box, Flex, Grid, Button, Link, Text, Heading, Image, Card, Label, Input, Select, Textarea, Radio, Checkbox, Slider, Field, Progress, Donut, Spinner, Avatar, Badge, Close, Alert, Divider, Embed, AspectRati, AspectImag, Containe, NavLin, Message, IconButton, MenuButton
```

Quite a lot of them, right?
With a little of multi-cursor karate, I've made a stub of the definitions.

```tsx
export const Box: React.FC;
export const Flex: React.FC;
//...
```

This isn't really useful, but I'll make a commit and push to my fork in case
my computer blows up or anything.

19:39

I've looked a bit in theme-ui repo for issues including TypeScript and found
[this one](https://github.com/system-ui/theme-ui/issues/121). The last comment
is a question about `@theme-ui/components` from yesterday. I'm not the only
who needs it. Awesome.

I've added a simple test in `theme-ui__components-tests.tsx`. Just creating all
elements with no props. I had to modify paths in tsconfig to get the import
working, because there's a lint rule here prohibiting relative imports.

```json
  "paths": {
      "@theme-ui/components": ["theme-ui__components"]
  },
```

Let's start from the [Box](https://github.com/system-ui/theme-ui/blob/master/packages/components/src/Box.js).
This should be the hardest one.

19:48

There are some dependencies here.

```tsx
import styled from "@emotion/styled";
import css, { get } from "@styled-system/css";
import { createShouldForwardProp } from "@styled-system/should-forward-prop";
import space from "@styled-system/space";
import color from "@styled-system/color";
```

I have a strong feeling that I'll need types from them.
I'll have to add package.json with the ones that have types outside of DT to
my theme-ui\_\_components directory and add
them to [dependencies whitelist](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/#i-notice-some-packages-having-a-packagejson-here)
in types publisher, if they're not there already.

This leaves me with styled-system packages. I'll add `@styled-system/css`
to paths and I'll just ignore the props given by `space` and `color` for now.

Box gets its props from these 5 functions:

```
  base,
  variant,
  space,
  color,
  sx,
  props => props.css
```

So `sx` and `css` props give us a css prop syntax with no JSX pragma.
This gets me to

```tsx
export interface BoxProps {
  css: Interpolation;
  sx: SxStyleProp;
}
```

20:21

Gotta take a break now. I'll continue in the morning. Maybe I'll even post a
half-assed PR so the other guy could continue my work.

08:20

I'm starting work at 10. I gotta move fast.
`variant` will be a string, and I've just [found](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/blob/288692b272b695eda00a47f93339e1e16ee756b1/types/styled-system__css/index.d.ts#L452) the names of space props. Not sure what to do with them yet.
Should I pick them from `AllSystemCSSProperties`?

I'm getting `any` in `sx` prop properties in tests 😢
Since the dependency on `@styled-system/css` is aliased and `@styled-system/css`
depends on `csstype`, I'm gonna go to `types/styled-system__css` dir and
run `yarn`.

```tsx
(property) bg?: string | string[] | SystemCssProperties | CSSPseudoSelectorProps | CSSSelectorObject | VariantProperty | UseThemeFunction | (string | ... 2 more ... | undefined)[] | ((theme: any) => ResponsiveStyleValue<...>) | undefined
---
The background-color CSS property sets the background color of an element.
```

Beautiful.

08:55

Okay, I've found actual `SpaceProps` type in `@types/styled-system`.
I've already started building this type, copying JSDocs from `AliasesCSSProperties`.

```tsx
interface StyledSystemSpaceProps {
  /**
    * The **`margin`** CSS property sets the margin area on all four sides of an element. It is a shorthand for `margin-top`, `margin-right`, `margin-bottom`, and `margin-left`.
    *
    * | Chrome | Firefox | Safari |  Edge  |  IE   |
    * | :----: | :-----: | :----: | :----: | :---: |
    * | **1**  |  **1**  | **1**  | **12** | **3** |
    *
    * @see https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/margin
    */
  m: SystemCssProperties['m'];
  /**
    * The **`margin`** CSS property sets the margin area on all four sides of an element. It is a shorthand for `margin-top`, `margin-right`, `margin-bottom`, and `margin-left`.
    *
    * | Chrome | Firefox | Safari |  Edge  |  IE   |
    * | :----: | :-----: | :----: | :----: | :---: |
    * | **1**  |  **1**  | **1**  | **12** | **3** |
    *
    * @see https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/margin
    */
  margin: SystemCssProperties['margin'];
```

I'll save myself the trouble and extend SpaceProps.

```tsx
import { SpaceProps, ColorProps } from "styled-system";

export interface BoxProps extends SpaceProps, ColorProps {
  variant?: string;
  sx?: SxStyleProp;
  css?: Interpolation;
}
export const Box: React.FC<BoxProps>;
```

Okay, but Box is created with `@emotion/styled` so it should be `StyledComponent`

```tsx
export interface BoxStyleProps extends SpaceProps, ColorProps {
  variant?: string;
  sx?: SxStyleProp;
  css?: Interpolation;
}
export const Box: StyledComponent<
  React.ComponentProps<"div">,
  BoxStyleProps,
  {}
>;
```

We can use `withComponent` to substitute the div inside Box with something else.

```tsx
const SectionBox = Box.withComponent("section");
```

And on top of it, we now support all `div` props, like `contentEditable` or `tabIndex`.

We get [Flex](https://github.com/system-ui/theme-ui/blob/master/packages/components/src/Flex.js) for free.
It's just a Box with `display: flex`.

The [Grid](https://github.com/system-ui/theme-ui/blob/master/packages/components/src/Grid.js)
has `width`, `columns` and `gap`.

The Grid forwards ref to Box, so we have to check what `forwardRef` returns.

```tsx
React.ForwardRefExoticComponent<React.PropsWithoutRef<P> & React.RefAttributes<T>>
```

Brilliant. Let's alias it to `ForwardRef<T, P>`.

```tsx
export interface BoxProps
  extends Omit<React.ComponentProps<"div">, "color" | "css">,
    BoxStyleProps {}
export interface GridProps extends BoxProps {
  /**
   * Minimum width of child elements
   */
  width?: ResponsiveValue<string | number>;
  /**
   * 	Number of columns to use for the layout (cannot be used in conjunction with the width prop)
   */
  columns?: ResponsiveValue<number>;
  /**
   * Space between child elements
   */
  gap?: ResponsiveValue<string | number>;
}
export const Grid: ForwardRef<HTMLDivElement, GridProps>;
```

"Cannot be used in conjunction" suggests a union type, but I'm afraid of [TS2589](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/34933)
so I'll pass.

09:24

It's getting a bit late already, so I'll add a bit more and do the PR.

```tsx
export interface ButtonProps
  extends Assign<React.ComponentPropsWithRef<"button">, BoxStyleProps> {}
export const Button: ForwardRef<HTMLButtonElement, BoxProps>;

export interface LinkProps
  extends Assign<React.ComponentPropsWithRef<"a">, BoxStyleProps> {}
export const Link: ForwardRef<HTMLAnchorElement, LinkProps>;

export type TextProps = BoxProps;
export const Text: ForwardRef<HTMLDivElement, BoxProps>;

export interface HeadingProps
  extends Assign<React.ComponentPropsWithRef<"h2">, BoxStyleProps> {}
export const Heading: ForwardRef<HTMLHeadingElement, HeadingProps>;
```

Continuing from this point should be a bit more pleasant.
