## Guidelines on color and contrast

> **1.4.1 Use of Color**
>
> Color is not used as the only visual means of conveying information,
> indicating an action, prompting a response, or distinguishing a visual
> element. (Level A)

> forms of perception are covered in
> [Guideline 1.3](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/#content-structure-separation)
> including programmatic access to color and other visual presentation coding.

> least 4.5:1, except for the following: (Level AA)
>
> - Large Text: Large-scale text and images of large-scale text have a contrast
>   ratio of at least 3:1;
> - Incidental: Text or images of text that are part of an inactive user
>   interface component, that are pure decoration, that are not visible to
