title: Writing `rm` because of Windows
---

## Problem

I happen to have a Windows laptop in my possession, and I'm stubborn enough to
use it for coding in addition to my work MacBook. Fortunately, I am also
stubborn enough to get it to work.

### _rm -rf_ doesn't work on Windows.

Powershell has _[Remove-Item]_ aliased to _rm_. This would almost solve the
problem, but...

```
Remove-Item : A parameter cannot be found that matches parameter name 'rf'.
At line:1 char:4
+ rm -rf dist
```

Powershell, unlike _[getopt]_, doesn't allow specifying multiple options
together.

_rm -r -f_ doesn't work too, because _-f_ is ambiguous.

```
Remove-Item : Parameter cannot be processed because the parameter name 'f' is ambiguous.
Possible matches include: -Filter -Force.
At line:1 char:7
+ rm -r -f dist
```

All right, for a few months I've been writing _rm -r -fo_ whenever I had to
remove `node_modules`.

I aliased[^1] it to _rmrf_ for convenience and with the following

```powershell
function rmrf {
  param(
        [parameter(Position=0)][string]$directory
  )
  process {
      # rm -r -fo $directory
      Remove-Item -Recurse -Force $directory
  }
}
```

[^1]:
    Powershell aliases can't be used to partially apply arguments. Docs for
    _[Set-Alias]_ basically tell you to write a function instead.

[remove-item]:
  https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.management/remove-item?view=powershell-7.2
[getopt]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getopt
[set-alias]:
  https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.utility/set-alias?view=powershell-7#example-5-create-an-alias-for-a-command-with-parameters

That was working nicely, until I landed in an environment where everybody except
of me had a MacBook and all scripts were written with that assumption.

### Alias was not enough

When I started my career in Polish software companies, we often had somebody on
MacOS, somebody on Linux and somebody on Windows in the team. Mac was a bit more
popular as a standard _company issued notebook for developers_, but we usually
had a mix.

When I work on open source, the projects are usually system agnostic (it's not
super hard in web ecosystem), using `rimraf` instead of `rm -rf`, using
`dotenv`, writing scripts in JavaScript or Python etc.

Surprisingly, 41.2% StackOverflow Survey respondents use Windows and only 30%
use MacOS.

[![StackOverflow Developer Survey](https://old-hasparus.netlify.app/static/f96ce0f11fa55211b0739e3d97faf5cd/fe9f1/2022-05-14-14-47-10.png)](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2021#most-popular-technologies-op-sys-prof)

My anecdata looks more like 75% MacOS, 15% Linux, 10% Windows, but from a
perspective of open source guy, I wouldn't want to break the build for 10% of
users or lose 10% of contributors.

However, in a startup setting, the situation is totally different.

The company offered to buy me a Mac, but the orders take about 7 weeks. So, I
had a choice. I could either bother my teammates to make the project
system-agnostic, or deal with it on my side.

A smarter man might have gone to the store, get any MacBook they have, and be
done with it.

## Writing my own `rm` in Rust

Googling "rm for Windows" didn't get me any useful results, so I quickly wrote
my own, very dirty, totally not production-grade, `rm` to stick in my `bin`
directory.

<Callout>

**Disclaimer:** Writing the code took me less time than I've been writing this
note, so I provide no guarantees to the quality and correctness of the code. I
didn't even write any error messages, because exposing the error from `std::fs`
is totally fine for my use case.

</Callout>

<details>
  <summary><code>main.rs</code></summary>

```rust
use clap::Parser;

#[derive(Parser, Debug)]
#[clap(author, version, about, long_about = None)]
struct Args {
  #[clap(short, long)]
  recursive: bool,

  #[clap(short, long)]
  force: bool,

  #[clap()]
  files: Vec<String>,
}

fn rm(args: Args) -> std::io::Result<()> {
  for file in args.files {
      if args.recursive {
          if args.force {
              std::fs::remove_dir_all(file)?;
          } else {
              std::fs::remove_dir(file)?;
          }
      } else {
          std::fs::remove_file(file)?;
      }
  }

  return std::io::Result::Ok(());
}

fn main() {
  let args = Args::parse();
  Result::unwrap(rm(args))
}
```

<summary><code>Cargo.toml</code></summary>

name = "rust-rm"
version = "0.1.0"

[dependencies]
clap = { version = "3.1.18", features = ["derive"] }
```

I removed the alias by adding the following to my `$PROFILE`.

```powershell
Remove-Item -Path Alias:rm
```

I promptly ran `cargo build --release` and I added my newest toy to a directory
I already had in `PATH`.

```
‚ùØ ls

    Directory: D:\tools\bin
