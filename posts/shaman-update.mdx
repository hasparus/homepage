You might have noticed the game got patched and there's a new class.

If you've been playing a Wizard like me for your entire adult life, you might
find this a bit spooky.

We've been deciphering and crafting spells, learning math and physics, diving
deep into insurmountable complexity.

We've made some money on it. But we also had fun.

The game changed. A lot of my friends told me they just don't find managing
Claude Code pleasant. _I_ don't find managing Claude Code pleasant.

I'm trying to, though. I'm changing my build into Wizard 11, Shaman 1.

I hope I can find joy in wielding multiple genies and demons, (AI agents)
forcing them to do my bidding, defending from their attempts to snitch on me or
worse.

There is some technical complexity to it that might be fun. The idea sounds nice
if you paint it with some fantasy framing or if you look at it through cyberpunk
lens.

<aside>
  TBF we already live in cyberpunk. We have drone warfare, billionaires in
  governments. We're only missing bodymodding.
</aside>

It also helps to notice just _how bad_ the vibe-coded stuff from people who
don't know what they're doing is. My comp sci degree, my decade of experience:
It's not gonna go to waste even if AI writes majority of my code.

<aside>
  Remember Tea app leak? Half the people I hang out with would've told the guy
  to double check Firebase. It's __always__ Firebase.
</aside>

I hope this framing can help you find some joy in it too.

I'm gonna keep a list of workflows and behavior patterns I've found useful for
my work.

## Invocations

- **Make sure we didn't mess it up.**
  - With Lighthouse and Vercel MCPs I iterated on perf improvements for the new
    GraphQL.org website by running an audit on each new deployment. This was
    faster than doing it manually because the LLM took care of diffing and I
    could focus on the code without leaving the editor, without changing the
    browser tab on my 14inch macbook. Sounds silly, but I'm internet-rich
    screen-space-constrained.
- **Build the thing to build the thing.**
  - Game developers do it all the time. You build a level editor.
    - example: https://x.com/geoffreylitt/status/1960344454348292374
    - I did something similar to Geoffrey's AI HUD but with Ink for a tricky
      migration (lots of global scope, file moves changed paths). Telling the
      genie to JUST DO IT (tm) ended terribly so I needed a workbench with
      before/after preview.

## Disclaimer

I have almost no idea how to get the most out of these new tools. It's AWESOME,
isn't it? I&nbsp;work the best and I have the most fun when diving into deep
water.

If you have some _alpha_ please share it somewhere and send me a link. Like any
new game update, this new class is super buggy and unpolished, but I think we
can all have a lot of fun and _maybe_ become more productive at the end of it.
