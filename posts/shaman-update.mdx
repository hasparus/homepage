You might have noticed the game got patched and there's a new class.

If you've been playing a Wizard like me for your entire adult life, you might
find this a bit spooky.

We've been deciphering and crafting spells, learning math and physics, diving
deep into insurmountable complexity.

We've made some money on it. But we also had fun.

The game changed. A lot of my friends told me they just don't find managing
Claude Code pleasant. _I_ don't find managing Claude Code pleasant.

I'm trying to, though. I'm changing my build into Wizard 11, Shaman 1.

I hope I can find joy in wielding multiple genies and demons, (AI agents)
forcing them to do my bidding, defending from their attempts to snitch on me or
worse.

There is some technical complexity to it that might be fun. The idea sounds nice
if you paint it with some fantasy framing or if you look at it through cyberpunk
lens.

<aside>
  TBF we already live in cyberpunk. We have drone warfare, billionaires in
  governments. We're only missing bodymodding.

It also helps to notice just _how bad_ the vibe-coded stuff from people who
don't know what they're doing is. My comp sci degree, my decade of experience:
It's not gonna go to waste even if AI writes majority of my code.

<aside>
  Remember Tea app leak? Half the people I hang out with would've told the guy
  to double check Firebase. It's __always__ Firebase.
</aside>

I hope this framing can help you find some joy in it too.

I'm gonna keep a list of workflows I've found useful for my work. Like, y'know,
Markdown scripts.
