The guy sitting next to me at the office has a&nbsp;wallpaper saying "ALWAYS
FUCKING DELIVER." This dude thinks I'm a good developer. He sometimes asks me
for tips or opinions on code-related stuff. Little does he know, I am a
developer-disappointment. When it comes to delivering, I ain't close to Jesus.
I'm actually closer to the [Polish Post].

I've started numerous side projects, which I didn't ship. A startup idea I was
working on with my close friend didn't get [sherlocked], which is hardly a good
thing, because we hadn't even started to ship when it was already too late.

I wanted to build a perfect product, with fantastic user experience, the newest
tech&nbsp;stack, and the&nbsp;cleanest code, while maintaining some degree of
personal life, passing exams, and completing a thesis. The thesis included an
app, which isn't&nbsp;production-ready (of course), but took more than five
hundred hours of work of&nbsp;my partner and me combined.

**Obviously, I was an idiot.** I bit off more than I could chew. I started
drinking way too much coffee. My, once thick and bushy hair started falling off,
and I'm probably skinnier than I ever was. I don't remember how to prove a thing
about Van&nbsp;Emde&nbsp;Boas trees or Fibonacci heaps.\
I can probably do a simple amortized analysis, nothing fancy, though.

On the flip side, I learned. I don't mean computer science. I got really good at
starting&nbsp;projects. I learned GraphQL, got a good grasp of the JavaScript
ecosystem with bundlers, React metaframeworks, and the like, but this isn't the
most valuable piece&nbsp;of knowledge I acquired.

I learned that **communication is key**. Unfortunately, in a hard way.

I learned that a good chunk of Medium software gurus and best practices prophets
spend more time marketing themselves than actually building software. Any
blogpost claiming that you should follow a few [simple] rules to be a good
developer is a hoax. Instead (unfortunately?), we have to strive to understand
the problem at hand, analyze the choices we have, and put in honest work.

How does my life look at the end of 2019?

I've got a side projects I could to write about, software and non-software,
including a&nbsp;huge one with the girl I like, but this is the time to stop
writing this blog post and get to work.
