It's eight past 1am, Sunday 1st of October 2022.

I'm sitting at airport cafe in Dubai, waiting for the second leg of my flight. I
didn't post anything to my website since April 2020. It didn't feel right. It
felt like it's somebody else's.

Twenty-twenties hold no punches. The world changed. You've lived it too, you
know the shit that happened. The pandemic, Russian invasion of Ukraine, and
whole set of crises milder than those two, yet still undoubtedly upsetting.

I protested the abortion ban and the plunge towards authoritarian rule, got
married, changed jobs, volunteered, caught COVID. Doom-scrolled a lot.

I changed. This website needs to change too.

design side of my website migration.
