It's eight past 1am, Sunday 1st of October 2022.

I'm sitting at airport cafe in Dubai, waiting for the second leg of my flight. I
didn't post anything to my website since April 2020. It didn't feel right. It
felt like it's somebody else's.

Twenty-twenties hold no punches. The world changed. You've lived it too, you
know the shit that happened. The pandemic, Russian invasion of Ukraine, and
whole set of crises milder than those two, yet still undoubtedly upsetting.

I protested the abortion ban and the plunge towards authoritarian rule, got
married, changed jobs, volunteered, caught COVID. Doom-scrolled a lot.

I changed. This website needs to change too.

I've managed a couple of years without redesigning my website, a nice score for
a person building user interfaces daily. Surprisingly, I'm not motivated by the
framework churn and the hype for Astro, nor frustration with the tech debt decay
and dependency drift of my previous homepage codebase.

Neither am I pursuing better performance metrics. Going from a static website
built with Gatsby to a static page built with Astro gets me less JavaScript
shipped, and shorter build times, but it's not a huge change.
