It's eight past 1am, Sunday 1st of October 2022.

I'm sitting at an airport cafe in Dubai, waiting for the second leg of my
flight. I didn't post anything to my website since April 2020. It didn't feel
right. It felt like the website is somebody else's.

Twenty-twenties hold no punches. The world changed. You've lived it too, you
know all that happened. The pandemic, Russian invasion of Ukraine, and whole set
of crises milder than those two, yet still undoubtedly upsetting.

I protested the abortion ban and the plunge towards authoritarian rule, got
married, changed jobs, volunteered, caught COVID. Doom-scrolled a lot.

I changed. This website needs to change too.

[The next post](./2023-homepage-rebuild.mdx) describes the tech and design of my
website migration.
