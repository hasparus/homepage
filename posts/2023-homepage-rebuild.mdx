I've managed a couple of years without redesigning my website, a nice score for
a person building user interfaces daily. Surprisingly, I'm not motivated by the
framework churn and the hype for Astro, nor frustration with the tech debt decay
and dependency drift of my previous homepage codebase.

Neither am I pursuing better performance metrics. Going from a static website
built with Gatsby to a static website built with Astro gets me less JavaScript
shipped, and shorter build times, and the fact that I don't have to use GraphQL
to read a markdown file, but it's not a _huge_ change.
