## Motivation

I've managed a couple of years without redesigning my website, a nice score for
a person building user interfaces daily. Surprisingly, I'm not motivated by the
framework churn and the hype for Astro, nor frustration with the tech debt decay
and dependency drift of my previous homepage codebase.

Neither am I pursuing better performance metrics. Going from a static website
built with Gatsby to a static website built with Astro gets me less JavaScript
shipped, shorter build times, and frees me from using GraphQL to read a markdown
file, but it's not a _huge_ change.

And to be frank, it's not like I was very frugal with my bundle size. I used
fp-ts to build a blog. I&nbsp;had&nbsp;_fun_.

**Fun is over. I'm a boring person now, and I want simplicity.**

Simpler tech, almost minimal design. I had handwrote and animated an SVG
hamburger for my menu icon on
[my old website](https://old-hasparus.netlify.app/). An actual sandwich. Good
lord, what an infant. I'm trying to do something more basic, more classic now.

## Design

To get to that _boring and classic_, I chose a grayscale color scale, ordinary
centered layout and Inter.

## Tech Stack

I've built an Astro starter, called [Zaduma] to work on all the features I want
in isolation, and not during writing a blogpost. [Aleksandra] had a Gatsby site
too, so now we're collaborating on it. I aim for [Zaduma] to be minimalistic
starter for technical weblogs and documentation pages. We've added some personal
touches like a grain overlay and [Shiki Twoslash][shiki-twoslash], assuming that
TypeScript is already a most popular programming language.

We went with [Astro], firstly because it just fits, and SSG is fair choice for a
blog. Secondly, because I started before Next 13 was announced, and Astro was
first on my list of new things to learn. We want to ship less JavaScript, and
get nice perf out of the box.

For the components framework, we're taking [Solid.js], because it's absurdly
good, especially coming from React. It still doesn't have enough of an
ecosystem, and until very recently it lacked equivalents of accessible
foundations style libraries like Radix UI, but I won't need much here. I'm fine
with writing my own command pallette instead of downloading `cmdk`.

[Tailwind] gets us a nice set of design tokens, and it's popular enough I can
use it in a public starter. Combined with the VSCode Extension, it becomes
arguably the best CSS-in-JS library, with an added benefit of not being a
CSS-in-JS library, so you can use it in your old Rails projects and on your
mom's Wordpress website. If you're not a person who builds design systems and
frontend tooling daily, and you don't have time to check out every CSS solution,
stick with Tailwind. Tailwind wins the contest for performance **(TODO: Link
Markbage's issue and Twitter.)**, and includes surprisingly small number of
footguns. It's just good.

[Vercel OG][vercel-og] takes care of social card pictures. It was a bit of an
investment to set it up on Vercel Edge Functions with Astro, but I feel it will
pay off.

## Performance & Metrics

There are some perf improvements that could have been done on my old site, but
it's still all green.

export const Temporary = () => {
  /*  Uncomment when images are no longer clipped in Zaduma
 To be honest, this would be nice as a row/table with a lightbox
 Tailwind should probably look into MDX files too
 ![](/content/2023-homepage-rebuild/old-desktop.png) 
 ![](/content/2023-homepage-rebuild/old-mobile.png) */
  return null;
};

With Astro Image and Plaiceholder, we top that.
