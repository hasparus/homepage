## Motivation

I've managed a couple of years without redesigning my website, a nice score for
a person building user interfaces daily. Surprisingly, I'm not motivated by the
framework churn and the hype for Astro, nor frustration with the tech debt decay
and dependency drift of my previous homepage codebase.

Neither am I pursuing better performance metrics. Going from a static website
built with Gatsby to a static website built with Astro gets me less JavaScript
shipped, shorter build times, and frees me from using GraphQL to read a markdown
file, but it's not a _huge_ change.

And to be frank, it's not like I was very frugal with my bundle size. I used
fp-ts to build a blog. I&nbsp;had&nbsp;_fun_.

**Fun is over. I'm a boring person now, and I want simplicity.**

Simpler tech, almost minimal design. I had handwrote and animated an SVG hamburger for my menu icon on [my old website](https://old-hasparus.netlify.app/). An actual sandwich. Good lord, what an infant. I'm trying to do something more basic, more classic now.

## Performance & Metrics

There are some perf improvements that could have been done on my old site, but
it's still all green.

export const Temporary = () => {
  /*  Uncomment when images are no longer clipped in Zaduma
 To be honest, this would be nice as a row/table with a lightbox
 Tailwind should probably look into MDX files too

  return null;
};
