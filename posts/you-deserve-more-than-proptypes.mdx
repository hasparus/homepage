  **Epistemic Effort:** I've spent a good amount of time discussing it. I'd love

I'll start with reasons why I think PropTypes are not good enough, and later
I'll show what TypeScript gives you to solve these problems and improve your
React code even more on top of it.

I'd like to be clear -- I'm not bashing
[prop-types](https://www.npmjs.com/package/prop-types) -- It's a really good
library, but the last publish was 9 months ago. As I'm writing this, it's
November 2019, and there are much better alternatives for prop types.

I've chosen TypeScript because of its popularity, but my arguments fit any
language with first-class type composition you can use to build React apps
(Flow,&nbsp;Reason, Kotlin, Scala).

## Why?

### It's easy to half-ass PropTypes

I've seen too many of lines like this:

```js
//eslint-disable-next-line react/forbid-prop-types
```

Few codebases leverage PropTypes to their full potential -- mostly libraries
(see [Reach UI tabs]).

[reach ui tabs]:
  https://github.com/reach/reach-ui/blob/master/packages/tabs/src/index.js#L68

I find exporting propTypes uncommon. Instead of using exported common types,
developers either use PropTypes.object or copy PropTypes.shape from another
component.

Maybe it is hard to remember that you strip them out in production build, and
that's why the devs I've met don't want to make them too big and heavy?

### PropTypes.func is not enough

Functions make stuff happen. They are pretty important. Types of functions are
important too. Stating that a prop is just a function, doesn't document intent.
You still need to read the implementation to get the slightest idea of what's
happening.

<figure>

```kt
interface VideoListProps : RProps {
    var videos: List<Video>
    var selectedVideo: Video?
    var onSelectVideo: (Video) -> Unit
}
```

[Kotlin React tutorial](https://play.kotlinlang.org/hands-on/Building%20Web%20Applications%20with%20React%20and%20Kotlin%20JS/05_Working_Together_Composing_Components)

</figcaption>

</figure>

Take a look at the props above. `onSelectVideo` takes a video and returns a
unit. This is a lot more information than "`onSelectVideo` is a function". We
could argue that the name of the function should be enough, but what if a
possibility to select multiple videos was added later, as an additional feature?
If someone forgot to change the function name, `PropTypes.func` would still fit,
and some other poor soul would get surprised by a runtime error.

### Optional by default

Optional is a bad default for application code.

I do agree that nullable by default is a good design choice in some cases.
GraphQL is a [perfect example]. Responses stitched from many data stores may return
partial data. This is the complexity we have to handle.

And I'd say we have about enough of it. We should avoid introducing more
complexity ourselves. Every optional field without a default of the same type
increases cyclomatic complexity.

[perfect example]: https://github.com/graphql/graphql-spec/issues/63

<figure>

```js
Person.propTypes = {
  car: PropTypes.shape({
    registrationNumber: PropTypes.string,
    year: PropTypes.number,
  }),
};
```

<figcaption>

[first blogpost](https://codeburst.io/validating-props-easily-with-react-proptypes-96e80208207)
in google search results for "PropTypes isRequired"

</figcaption>

</figure>

Does this person have a car? Maybe. I live in a big city; I don't have one too.
But is an empty object `{}` really a valid car for our app? Do we display an
error message here? Did we just forget to write `isRequired`, or are we okay
with cars without license plates?

Typing `isRequired` is yet another small decision for a programmer. The fact
that stating that a prop is nullable is an easier way allows to accidentally
introduce complexity. `isOptional` instead of `isRequired` would be a better API
design.

## type Props = ?

TypeScript is much better in describing React component props than PropTypes.
Let's look at how it solves the problems I've mentioned before.

### Harder to half-ass

Add `strict: true` to your tsconfig.json, stray from `any` and now you're forced
to maintain a decent level of type safety. Also, it's pretty obvious, even
before a morning coffee, that it has no runtime cost.

### Typing functions

`(selected: Video) => void`. Pretty easy, amiright? Programming, even OOP, is
mostly about using functions to do stuff. Ability to describe the type of a
function is quite useful.

### Required by default

In TypeScript, you gotta stick this `?` every time you want an optional
property.

<figure>

```ts
type Car = {
  registrationNumber: string;
  year?: number;
};
```

<figcaption>We deal only with registered cars up in here.</figcaption>

</figure>

And look at what else we get!

{/* ### `ComponentProps<"button">` */}

I could talk about subtyping and Liskov Substitution Principle, but I'll
simplify it a little bit. **If it's a button, it should be buttony.**\
Props you expect on a button should be accepted by all of your design system
buttons. What do I expect? At least `onClick`, `onFocus`, `disabled`,
`className`, and `style`. We can handle all attributes of HTML
[`<button>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/button)
element, including all
[global attributes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes)
with a simple [spread](https://reactpatterns.com/#jsx-spread-attributes)

<figure>

```tsx
import { ComponentProps, FC } from "react";

type ButtonVariant = "default" | "call-to-action";

interface ButtonProps extends ComponentProps<"button"> {
  variant?: ButtonVariant;
}
```

</figure>

Do you want **your Button** to be inferior to **a button**? I don't think so.

{/* ### `Omit<LinkProps, "to">` */}

But what if my component comes "batteries included" and I don't want to accept
all props of the component I'm building upon?\
Only like... most of them? We can Omit what we don't like. Just like that.

```tsx
interface JoinMeetingButton
  extends Omit<ButtonProps, "onClick">,
    Pick<Meeting, "id"> {}
```

### Union Types

The anchors and the buttons often look the same in the mockups, but they are
different kinds of animals. We want to reuse the styling and behavior between
them and make choosing the right one for the job effortless.

We can use [union types] to build a Button component which renders an anchor, given
a `href` prop and renders a `<button>` otherwise.

[union types]:
  https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/advanced-types.html#union-types

```tsx
import { ComponentProps } from "react";

interface ButtonAsAnchorProps extends ComponentProps<"a"> {
  href: string;
}
interface ButtonAsButtonProps extends ComponentProps<"button"> {
  href?: undefined;
}

type ButtonProps = ButtonAsAnchorProps | ButtonAsButtonProps;

function Button({ className: propsClassName, ...rest }: ButtonProps) {
  const className = ["Button", propsClassName].join(" ");

  if (rest.href !== undefined) {
    return <a className={className} {...rest} />;
  }

  return <button className={className} {...rest} />;
}
```

### `Picking` a subset

We can select properties from our types with `Pick`.

```tsx
type MeetingInfoProps = Pick<Meeting, "date" | "organizer">;
const MeetingInfo = ({ date, organizer }: MeetingInfoProps) => (
  <>
    {new Date(date).toLocaleString()} • {organizer.name}
  </>
);
```

Imagine that _Meeting_ is a type of data we get from the backend. We want to
show MeetingInfo -- a date and organizer of the meeting and we don't really care
about the type of these `date` and `organizer` props. We care about their
origin. They come from the _Meeting_ type and that's what's important for this
component. Will this component break when the representation of our meetings
change? Yes. And we want it to.

Also,&nbsp;[we&nbsp;avoid introducing new names][new-names]:
{/* prettier-ignore */}
```tsx
<MeetingInfo
  author={meeting.organizer}
/>
```

## Summary

PropTypes are not _first class_. They're a library trying to implement what is
often a language feature. If you're building an app, you don't need runtime
typechecking. Try swapping `prop-types` for TypeScript or Flow and
[tweet me](https://twitter.com/hasparus) what you think.
